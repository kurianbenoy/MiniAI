================

## Overview

These are the notebooks that are being used for part 2 of fast.ai's 2022 course. It will be released as a MOOC in early 2023.

During the course we are building a deep learning framework called "miniai" from scratch. It is created from these notebooks using `nbdev`.

## Install

Clone this repo, `cd` to it, and run:

``` sh
pip install -e .
```

This installs the `miniai` library which we're creating in this course.
